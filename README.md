pxweb is an R package to interface with the PX-WEB API, and it offers
methods to utilize information about the data hierarchy stored behind
the PX-WEB API used by Statistics authorities in Finland, Sweden and
many other countries. Many API services are still in their early
stages, and data quality is sometimes compromised. Issue reports are
welcome.

The pxweb package is a part of the international R open government
data and computation project [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io/).

For installation and usage, check the [tutorial page](https://github.com/rOpenGov/pxweb/blob/master/vignettes/pxweb.Rmd).
