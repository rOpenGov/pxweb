Description: Generic interface for the PX-Web/PC-Axis API. The PX-Web/PC-Axis
    API is used by organizations such as Statistics Sweden and Statistics
    Finland to disseminate data. The R package can interact with all
    PX-Web/PC-Axis APIs to fetch information about the data hierarchy, extract
    metadata and extract and parse statistics to R data.frame format. PX-Web is
    a solution to disseminate PC-Axis data files in dynamic tables on the web.
    Since 2013 PX-Web contains an API to disseminate PC-Axis files.
